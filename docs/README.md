# Manchester Property Challenge – LBG

## Overview

This repository contains my submission for the Lloyds Banking Group Manchester Property Sales Challenge.

### Summary and Goals

To summarise this project, I will be working with a dataset in Parquet format to explore property-related data in Manchester. The primary goal is to analyse, clean, and transform the dataset to uncover meaningful insights about property trends, pricing, and geographic distribution. This will involve:

- Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, standardising formats, and ensuring consistency.

- Exploratory Analysis: Visualising key metrics and identifying patterns or anomalies.

- Geospatial Insights: Mapping property data to understand location-based trends.

- Documentation: Clearly outlining the process, decisions, and findings for reproducibility.

The ultimate aim is to produce a well-structured, insightful analysis that could inform stakeholders or serve as a foundation for further development, whether that’s a dashboard, report, or machine learning model.

## Tech Stack

**Languages and Libraries**

- Python: Main language for processing and analysing data.
  - Polars: Efficient columnar data manipulation.
  - PyArrow: Parquet file handling and interoperability.

**Tools**

- Power BI for data visualisation.
- GitHub for version control.
